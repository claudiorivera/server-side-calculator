# server-side-calculator

This is a simple server-side calculator. The back end uses Express, and the front end is vanilla Javascript (although, Bootstrap was used for styling, which requires jQuery and Popper.js).

The results display updates in real time when any user adds a calculation (using Socket.io).

# Known Bugs

The client-side input validation is not consistent (ie. buttons are enabled/disabled at incorrect times). I will re-visit this later.
