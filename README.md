# server-side-calculator

This is a simple server-side calculator, which was made for a homework assignment. The backend uses Express, and the front end is vanilla Javascript (although, Bootstrap was used for styling, which requires jQuery and Popper.js).

# Known Bugs

This was one of my first projects ever, so there are many bugs with regard to async calls to the server. I may re-visit this some day and fix them, but I'm leaving this up for posterity. My later projects are much better! Haha.
